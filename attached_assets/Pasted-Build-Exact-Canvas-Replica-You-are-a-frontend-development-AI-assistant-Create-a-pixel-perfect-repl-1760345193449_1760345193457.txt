Build Exact Canvas Replica

You are a frontend development AI assistant. Create a pixel-perfect replica of the page shown in this Canvas:
https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/68eb9888ade081919f5009aa5d052769.

Follow these rules strictly:


---

1. Tech Stack

React (functional components, hooks)

Vite build system

Tailwind CSS (v4, with PostCSS config via @tailwindcss/postcss)

Framer Motion for animations

Use ES Modules (modern syntax)



---

2. Fonts & Theme

Import Playfair Display for headings

Import Inter (or a clean sans serif) for body text

Use the exact pink/rose tones from the Canvas

Set background and card colors exactly as in the design

Use Tailwind's theme.extend to add custom colors and fonts matching the Canvas



---

3. Layout & Components

Recreate exactly the page layout, including:

Navbar (transparent / backdrop blur background, brand name, menu links)

Hero section (full-width image background, dark overlay, centered title & subtitle, “Shop the Collection” button)

Category filter bar (rounded pills, horizontal scroll on mobile)

Product grid (responsive columns, same spacing & aspect ratio)

Product cards (image, stock label overlay, name, price, color dots/text, sizes, “Order on WhatsApp” button)

Testimonials / feature sections as in the Canvas

Footer (centered text)

Floating WhatsApp button with small bounce animation

Smooth scroll behavior when clicking buttons



---

4. Interactions & Animations

Fade-in / slide-up animations for headings & product cards using Framer Motion

Button hover scale effect

Scroll behavior: smooth

Mobile menu open/close (if menu behavior exists in Canvas)

Floating button should loop bounce



---

5. Responsiveness

The page must look identical on mobile and desktop as the Canvas shows

Use Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, etc) to match layout changes

Image cropping / aspect ratio should be preserved



---

6. Data & Logic

Use a products array in a data file, matching sample images and names from your current set

Filtering logic via useState / useMemo (no context or complex structures)

WhatsApp button should open https://wa.me/ links with message encoding

Default filter = “All”



---

7. Folder & File Structure

Use a clean structure like:

src/
 ├── components/
 │    Navbar.jsx
 │    Hero.jsx
 │    Categories.jsx
 │    ProductCard.jsx
 │    ProductGrid.jsx
 │    Testimonials.jsx
 │    Footer.jsx
 ├── data/
 │    products.js
 ├── App.jsx
 ├── main.jsx
 └── index.css


---

10. Final Deliverable

Provide complete source files (JSX, CSS, config) that, when run with npm install && npm run dev, produce a page indistinguishable from the Canvas link.
